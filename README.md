# Introduction 
The code has been intentionally written in a messy and suboptimal way to serve as a "test exercise."
This solution is purely for practice and can be modified in any way you see fit. During a potential interview, we will discuss the changes you made and the reasoning behind them.

# Expectations
Here’s what we’d like you to work on:

1. Refactor the code
	Identify and fix any issues you notice to demonstrate how you would design and structure the solution.

2. Add a missing endpoint
	Implement the "Get Report" endpoint (refer to GetPurchaseReportById in PurchasesController). We expect the output to follow a format similar to the example below:

```csv
      CustomerName:,John Doe,,
      ProductId,Count,ProductName,Price
      1,1,Bread,4
      3,2,Cheese,6
      4,1,TV,200
``` 

There is no strict time limit for reworking the solution. If you believe certain improvements are worth making but would take too much time, feel free to provide a brief description of what you’d like to do and why, if given more time.

# Evaluation
The result of this exercise will serve as a starting point for the technical interview.
During the interview, you will be asked technical questions, and we will review your solution to this test together.
This home test and the interview are components of the overall evaluation process. We will consider your experience and other relevant factors throughout.
